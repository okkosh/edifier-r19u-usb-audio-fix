# Edifier R19U Balance Fix
Fixes balance issues with Left and Right channel while using the USB Input.

**How to Install**
- Download [Balance.exe](https://github.com/rkosh/edifier-r19u-usb-audio-fix/releases/download/v1.0/Balance.exe) file.
- Place it anywhere on your system.
- *Double Click* **Balance.exe** and It will show up in your tray.
- Enjoy!

**How to Remove**
- Exit Balance.exe from tray (If it is already running).
- Delete Balance.exe file (Duh!).

**Starting Automatically with Windows**
1. Press `windows key + r`
2. Copy the run command `Shell:startup`
3. It will reach `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` 
4. Create a shortcut of the `Balance.exe` file here.
5. That's it!

**Build From Source**
- Download Autohotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/ (Version 1.1 recommended).
- Clone the Repo.
- Compile on your system and that's it!

**Notes**
- It only works for the Edifier R19U USB audio device
- You'll hear a 1 second delay (which is Intentional) before the audio is perfectly balance
